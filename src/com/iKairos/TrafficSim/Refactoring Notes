* Tell Don't ask:
    The Vehicle should be told to translate and not asked for its properties so they may be manipulated from outside it.
    This should extend to all other classes like Lane, Edge, etc
* Should IDM be in full form? Should LaneChangeModel be in full form? Do they have to have "Model" at the end if they
    are already in the Models package?
* Printing code shouldn't be in the Domain object classes! Find out a way to clean that up!!!!!!
* The Network should create itself. Simulation should just pass it the data it needs. Tell Don't Ask!!
* Move DummyLeadingVehicle instantiation to Constants.
* Create ant build.xml to automate tests
