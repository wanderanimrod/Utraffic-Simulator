EdgeType should be gotten rid of. Different EdgeTypes getNextLane differently. They should be different classes that
implement the edge interface

Remove the setters for acceleration, position and velocity on vehicles. If we want a car to be in a certain state in tests,
we should make it translate once, while mocking acceleration so that we can achieve the velocity or position we need
without having the evil setters

**** It is actually bad to have centralised IDM and MOBIL models, or centralised instances of them because if we go to
concurrency, any thread using the services of the same instances of the IDM can be interrupted by another and the
other thread will find the data in a weird state. Therefore, for the purposes of resource isolation and good modeling,
keeping an instance of the IDM and MOBIL for each vehicle is the best thing to do. ****
